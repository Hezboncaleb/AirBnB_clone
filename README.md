AirBnB clone - The console

Background Context
This is a command line interpreter to manage my AirBnB objects
This is the first step towards building my first full web application, the AirBnB clone.
It includes Models and tests

Each task is linked and will help to:

put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of my future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
create all unittests to validate all my classes and storage engine
